Writers Jam is a simple writing exercise where people get together to create and celebrate each
other's work!

The rules are simple:

- **Write a minimum of 100 words on a given theme**, no upper limit. Themes change the first Sunday
  of every month, at noon IST. You can write all month, but you are encouraged to write with us on
  Sundays when people are most likely to be active.
- **Any format is allowed**: essay, poem, short story, journal, play, etc.
- **You must write an original piece for the event**. Please don't post something you've already
  written - the idea is for you to explore new concepts and themes in a low-stress, judgment-free
  environment. A special theme category exists for posts submitted outside of an edition -- Select
  "No edition" when posting your piece!
- **[Post your submission](/post) to this website when done**. Feel free to join us in the
  [WhatsApp group]($WHATSAPP_URL) to share and discuss!
- Most importantly of all, have fun!

What are you waiting for?
