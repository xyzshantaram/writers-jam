Writers Jam is a simple writing exercise where people get together to create and celebrate each
other's work!

The rules are simple:

- **Write a minimum of 100 words on a given theme**, no upper limit. Themes change every Sunday. You
  can write all week, but you are encouraged to write with us on Sunday when people are most likely
  to be active.
- **Any format is allowed**: essay, poem, short story, journal, play, etc.
- **You must write an original piece for the event**. Please don't post something you've already
  written - the idea is for you to explore new concepts and themes in a low-stress, judgment-free
  environment. A special theme category exists for posts submitted outside of an edition -- Select
  "No edition" when posting your piece!
- **[Post your submission](/post) to this website when done**. Feel free to join us in the
  [WhatsApp group]($WHATSAPP_URL) to share and discuss!
- Most importantly of all, have fun!

The theme for this week is "**tell a tale of time travel**". _This is not a format restriction_ -
you can still submit poem, short story, play, or any other format. You are encouraged to get
creative with the theme. Write about mad scientists, a nostalgia trip to one's own past, a
bureaucrat processing visas, a wizard in another realm hurtling into the future... or something else
entirely. All of time is yours for the taking.

What are you waiting for?
