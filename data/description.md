Writers Jam is a simple writing exercise where people get together to create and celebrate each
other's work!

The rules are simple:

- **Write a minimum of 100 words on a given theme**, no upper limit. Themes change every Sunday. You
  can write all week, but you are encouraged to write with us on Sunday when people are most likely
  to be active.
- **Any format is allowed**: essay, poem, short story, journal, play, etc.
- **You must write an original piece for the event**. Please don't post something you've already
  written - the idea is for you to explore new concepts and themes in a low-stress, judgment-free
  environment.
- **[Post your submission](/post) to this website when done**. Feel free to join us in the
  [WhatsApp group]($WHATSAPP_URL) to share and discuss!
- Most importantly of all, have fun!

This week's theme is: **"The One That Got Away"**. You are encouraged to get creative with the
theme. Write about the Katy Perry song, a match-ending cricket ball, a missed flight or a lost
career opportunity. Anything, or anyone, that slipped through your fingers.

What are you waiting for?
