Writers Jam is a simple collaborative writing exercise where people get together
to create and celebrate each other's work!

The rules are simple:

- Write a minimum of 100 words on a given theme, no upper limit. Themes change
  every Sunday.
- This week's theme is: "How are you feeling?"
- You are encouraged to get creative with the theme. You can literally talk
  about your day, or use it as a dialogue or opening line in your story, or
  write about the phrase itself, or the history of asking people how they are...
  the possibilities are endless!
- When done, simply post your creation to this website! Feel free to join us in
  the WhatsApp group to discuss.

What are you waiting for?
