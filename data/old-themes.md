Hi all -

With tonight's theme, we'll be pausing Writers Jam for the next few months. To pause and reflect for a minute, this has been an amazing endeavour - over 300 posts across fifteen editions and 25k+ views. It's been quite a journey from a little WhatsApp group of 10 people to where we are now -- and I'd do it all over again in a heartbeat. Lovely to have shared this little corner of the internet with you all. 

Without further ado:

Writers Jam 16 is here! The theme for this week is A Temple to Your Memory. A bit topical given the recent news :P You are encouraged to get creative with the theme. Write about lost loves, Writers Jam, the Taj Mahal, Sonnet Fifty-Five, or something else entirely. What temples live in your memory?

Hope to see you all next year!
